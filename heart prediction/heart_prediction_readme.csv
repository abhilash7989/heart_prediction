# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project implements a **machine learning model** to predict the risk of **10-year coronary heart disease (CHD)** using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The model uses logistic regression and standard Python data science libraries.

 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
"- Pandas, NumPy"
"- Matplotlib, Seaborn"
"- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, StandardScaler, train_test_split)"
- CSV for data handling
 Features
""
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Drops unnecessary columns
   - Handles missing values (drop or fill with mean)
""
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Standardizes features
   - Splits data into training and testing sets
""
3. **Modeling:**
   - Logistic Regression model to predict 10-year CHD risk
""
4. **Evaluation:**
"   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report"
   - Plots for target distribution and trends
""
5. **Extras:**
   - Saves cleaned dataset (`framingham_cleaned.csv`)
   - Optional: save Python source code into CSV (`heart_prediction_code.csv`)

## 📊 Dataset
""
The dataset comes from the **Framingham Heart Study** and contains the following columns:
""
- `age` — Age of patient
"- `male` / `Sex_male` — Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)"
- `cigsPerDay` — Cigarettes smoked per day
- `totChol` — Total cholesterol
- `sysBP` — Systolic blood pressure
- `glucose` — Glucose level
"- `TenYearCHD` — Target variable (1 = develop CHD in 10 years, 0 = otherwise)"
""
> The `education` column is dropped as it is not used in this analysis.
